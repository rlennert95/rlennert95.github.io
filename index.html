<p class="text">Jeff you should buy a gaming PC because PS4 is trash. PSN is always broken, you have to pay 60 dollars a year to use it, the games are expensive, the games run like crap, no games older than a PS4, like 3 good exclusives where as PC has dozens, games run like crap, games run like crap, did I mention they run like crap?</p>
